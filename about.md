Hi, I'm Gabriele Balletti, a Stockholm based researcher and developer with an academic background in discrete geometry and computational mathematics. I left academia in early 2019 to work in the gaming industry. My main interests are computer vision/graphics, and I recently got into AI and deep learning.

I'm currently working in the R&D team of Gleechi, a Stockholm startup focusing on real-time human interaction in Virtual Reality.

I use this page as a sort of notebook, dumping material from my notes or presentations I gave at work/university. Don't expect anything fancy!

If you want to get in touch with me you can either add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-balletti/) or just use my personal mail `gabriele.balletti at gmail dot com`.
