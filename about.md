Hi, I'm Gabriele Balletti, a Stockholm based researcher and developer currently working as a machine learning engineer in the medical images team at ReySearch Laboratories, where we develop software used in treatment for cancer. I'm interested in the whole spectrum of machine learning, from the theoretical foundations to the applications, and I have an academic background in discrete geometry and computational mathematics.

I use this page as a sort of notebook, dumping material from my notes or presentations I gave at work/university. Don't expect anything fancy!

If you want to get in touch with me you can either add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-balletti/) or just use my personal mail `gabriele.balletti at gmail dot com`.
